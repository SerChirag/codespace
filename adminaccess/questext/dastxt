Tom is a teacher at ABC Public School. Every morning at 7:30 there is a morning assembly held in the school in which every student has to stand in lines(queues) according to their respective classes. Tom is the class teacher of 8th B of that school.<br />
Every class teacher has to ensure that the students are standing according to their heights(non decreasing order).<br />
But some students love to stand with their friends and sometimes they break the above mentioned rule. Help Tom to find the position of the kid who is standing at the wrong place and thus disturbing the whole queue.<br />
You will be given an array A carrying n elements. Every A[i] element denotes the height of (i+1) kid i.e. A[0],A[1],A[2] denoted the heights of students standing at position 1,2,3 respectively.<br />
Your task is to find out the the position of the student who is breaking the rule and return -1 if there is no such student.</p><br><h4>Input Format:</h4><br><p>First line contains number of test cases 't'.<br />
For each test case first line will contain the number 'n' denoting the number of students in the line. The next line will contain n integers denoting height of those</p><h4>Output Format</h4><p>For each test case output a single integer which is the position of the student breaking the rule or -1 if there is no such student.<br />
If there are two such possible answers then return the one which occurs first.</p>
        <br><h4>Constraints:</h4><p>Test cases should be less than 1000 . <br />
Number of students are less than 10000.<br />
Height of each student is a positive integer less than 10000.</p><br><h4>Example Test Cases:</h4> <br> <h5>Input Format</h5><p>3<br />
