<h2>Key and lost password</h2><h5>Problem Code:klp</h5><br><hr><br><p>Keval is a great hacker. But he is very lazy one. He has recently hacked into his college's database. In this, he found that the passwords of all the students are written in an encrypted form, to which there exists a decryption rule. The rule is based on a string of jumbled alphabets. The string contains all the 26 unique alphabets but in a jumbled form, not the regular "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz" form. The passwords are stored in format of string of numbers, ranging from 1 to 26, for each password. Keval could easily have made the code, but currently he wants to complete watching a whole season of a TV series. Help Keval by giving the right form of decrypted password using the decryption rule. </p><br><h4>Input Format:</h4><br><p>The first line of input will give the number of testcases T, in the input. The first line of each test case will carry a string containing the decryption rule. The string will be of exactly 26 length. The second line will contain the number of strings, N, which are following the above decryption rule. The next 2*N lines will contain the length of the password, n, in one line, and n space seperated integers, where each integers is ranging from 1 to 26.</p><h4>Output Format</h4><p>Output description.<br />
Output each decrypted password on a single line per test case. </p>
