<h2>Lucky Four</h2><h5>Problem Code:lf</h5><br><hr><br><p>Kostya likes the number 4 much. Of course! This number has such a lot of properties, like:<br />
<br />
    Four is the smallest composite number;<br />
    It is also the smallest Smith number;<br />
    The smallest non-cyclic group has four elements;<br />
    Four is the maximal degree of the equation that can be solved in radicals;<br />
    There is four-color theorem that states that any map can be colored in no more than four colors in such a way that no two adjacent regions are colored in the same color;<br />
    Lagrange's four-square theorem states that every positive integer can be written as the sum of at most four square numbers;<br />
    Four is the maximum number of dimensions of a real division algebra;<br />
    In bases 6 and 12, 4 is a 1-automorphic number;<br />
    And there are a lot more cool stuff about this number!<br />
<br />
Impressed by the power of this number, Kostya has begun to look for occurrences of four anywhere. He has a list of T integers, for each of them he wants to calculate the number of occurrences of the digit 4 in the decimal representation. He is too busy now, so please help him.</p><br><h4>Input Format:</h4><br><p>The first line of input consists of a single integer T, denoting the number of integers in Kostya's list.<br />
<br />
Then, there are T lines, each of them contain a single integer from the list.</p><h4>Output Format</h4><p><br />
<br />
Output T lines. Each of these lines should contain the number of occurences of the digit 4 in the respective integer from Kostya's list.</p>
        <br><h4>Constraints:</h4><p>1 ≤ T ≤ 100000<br />
0 ≤ Numbers from the list ≤ 100000000</p><br><h4>Example Test Cases:</h4> <br> <h5>Input Format</h5><p>5<br />
